ECMAScript 6 is Javascript specification standards so as to foster multiple independent implementations. ECMAScript is commonly used for not only client-side scripting but also server applications and services using Node.js. However, no modern browsers support ES6 at this time, it needs a compiler to compile ES6 to pure Javascript.

It is not easy to master all features in this ES6 version, but you might want to explore some popular changes that make your life easier. A simple demo released on github consists of use-cases as least as you may see once. It has both ES6 new code style and what people used to do without ES6.
