Elementor is a WordPress plugin which allows to build page templates, section templates with drag&drop method. I am not an Elementor or WordPress expert, however I would like to share cons&pros I feel about Elementor.

__Advantages:__
* easy drag&drop widget
* easy config
* speed up front-end process

__Disadvantages:__
* need money to get a plan (not sure if it's fair enough :)) )
* hard to modify widget's elements
* limitation of building global components

There are three ways you can create a custom widget:
* editing plugin: make changes inside the plugin folder directly. I believe you are laughing now, anyway at least it works. And it is NOT recommended.
* registering widget in your theme: register your widgets in your theme, properly in functions.php
* registering a plugin: create a plugin
